* Fix full path script invocation (yeti /some/fubar/script.yeti)
  + Use unique path identifiers (File? URL?) on module (re)compilation.
  + Fix the circular dependency checking (TODO in CompileCtx.compile()).
  + Look what's wrong with handling win32 paths
  + Bad error message on: echo 'module x; ()' > y.yeti; yeti -e 'load y'

All path matches described below will be done on canonical names
in case-insensitive manner. The path separators should be unified to '/'
before matching. The generated module classnames should be always
in lower case.

The module/program NAME IS always defined:
  * EXPLICITLY with module/program declaration.
  * IMPLICITLY from the source file name omitting the ".yeti" suffix.
    If SOURCEPATH is explicitly declared, the package part will be derived
    by matching the start of the canonical path with SOURCEPATH entries and
    adding the remaining path as package name.
    Shortest package name will be chosen on multiple matches.
    Root package ("") will used if there are no matches.
  Explicitly declared NAME in the form foo.bar.baz must be in source file
  named baz.yeti. If SOURCEPATH is explicitly declared, it's path must
  match SOURCEPATH-ENTRY/foo/bar/baz.yeti OR SOURCEPATH-ENTRY/baz.yeti
  for some SOURCEPATH entry. Alternatively NO SOURCEPATH entry should
  match the start of the source file path.
  Error must be given on incorrectly named modules/programs.

SOURCEPATH IS always defined:
  * EXPLICITLY with compiler options (may contain multiple directories)
  * IMPLICITLY a single directory
    + If the the canonical path ends with /foo/bar/baz(.yeti) matching
      the module/program NAME foo.bar.baz (case insensitive),
      the SOURCEPATH is the preceding part of the canonical path.
    + Otherwise the SOURCEPATH is the directory of source file.

When load foo.bar.baz is done the source file is searched with following rules:
  1) From lookup/compilation cache.
  2) From each SOURCEPATH entry in the form
     SOURCEPATH-ENTRY/foo/bar/baz.yeti
  3) If not found in previous step and the NAME contained dots,
     SOURCEPATH-ENTRY/baz.yeti
  The SOURCEPATH entry of the current compilation should be searched first?
  Probably not, either the path is explicit or contains single element,
  and if it's explicit, more consistent build is achieved when always
  searching in the same order.

Additionally the class foo/bar/baz.class should be searched from the classpath.
If neither the source or class is found, the module not found error should be
given.

If both are found, the modification times should be compared.
If the source file is newer or there is no class file, the module should
be recompiled, otherwise the existing class file should be used.

The module classes already compiled or looked up in the same compilation
session should be used without additional lookups.

The source finding logic (SOURCEPATH handling and source file lookup from it)
should be implemented in Yeti code, probably in the eval.yeti module.
The bootstrap SourceReader can be simplified to search from single source
directory with flat naming (suitable for the compiler modules and
c directories).
