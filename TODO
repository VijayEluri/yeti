   Yeti TODO.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Real pattern matching in case
* Foreign structs
* Better error messages
* Built-in regex support
* Some standard library
  + lazy list constructors
* Struct properties
* Struct and list patterns
* Extendable structs?
* Lambda inlineing optimisation
* Direct double optimisation, when it can be deduced,
  that there are always floats.
* Direct struct-ref optimisation, when only known structs are accessed
