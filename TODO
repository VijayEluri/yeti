   Yeti TODO.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Modules
  + parametric types correctly, disallow unknown types in module signature
  + dotted package names, dirs
  + depends on build
* Built-in hash maps
* Fix tail-call optimisation
* Comments
* Function compose operator
* Revise allowed symbols for identifiers
* Some IntNum methods are too eager on going to BigNum
  (|-MAXINT + MAXINT| < MAXINT) (probably RatNum too)
* Real pattern matching in case
* Better error messages
* Built-in regex support
* Some standard library
* Struct properties
* Foreign interface
* Lambda inlineing optimisation
* Direct double optimisation, when it can be deducted,
  that there are always floats.
* Direct struct-ref optimisation, when only known structs are accessed
