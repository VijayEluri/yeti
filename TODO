   Yeti TODO.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Occurs check (var fields and tags shouldn't be considered?)
* Compilation from files
* Report error locations
* Add source line information to the generated class files
* Modules
* Built-in hash maps
* Fix tail-call optimisation
* Comments
* Function compose operator
* Revise allowed symbols for identifiers
* Some IntNum methods are too eager on going to BigNum
  (|-MAXINT + MAXINT| < MAXINT) (probably RatNum too)
* Embedded expressions in strings. "foo = \(foo)\n"
* Syntactic sugar for const-lambda. \foo == do: foo done
* Real pattern matching in case
* Better error messages
* Built-in regex support
* Some standard library
* Foreign interface
* Lambda inlineing optimisation
* Direct double optimisation, when it can be deducted,
  that there are always floats.
* Direct struct-ref optimisation, when only known structs are accessed
