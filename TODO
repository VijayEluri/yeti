   Yeti TODO.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Revise allowed symbols for identifiers
* Some IntNum methods are too eager on going to BigNum
  (|-MAXINT + MAXINT| < MAXINT) (probably RatNum too)
* Fix MList == [] / != []
* Type declarations
  + Better type descriptions in error messages
* Real pattern matching in case
* Better error messages
* Built-in regex support
* Some standard library
  + lazy list constructors
* Struct properties
* Foreign interface
* Optimise Foo and (.foo) into constants
* Extendable structs?
* Lambda inlineing optimisation
* Direct double optimisation, when it can be deduced,
  that there are always floats.
* Direct struct-ref optimisation, when only known structs are accessed
